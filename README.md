Parking positions cant be automatically resolved
------------------------------------------------
In the Mission Editor it is not possible to place to units on the same parking
position. Although this can happen by the automatic merge of this script.
Because there is a for me unkown mapping between 'parking_id' and 'parking' it
is currently not possible to automatically resolve this. But you we get a
warning from the merge tool, to resolve it.

Solution: 
    Altough its possible that the game still works and automatically
    resolves this. It is recommended to go into the Mission Editor of the final
    merged map and change the position there for the affected units. Or change
    the conflicting positions in the Missions from the Flightleads.
